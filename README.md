This elevator is in the building where I work.

This elevator control interface is clean and it is clear what numbers and icons go to their respective buttons. This control interface also has braille on the buttons so a blind user is still able to operate the interface. The buttons do light up when pressed which is a clear indication of feedback. The layout of the floor buttons are going from the bottom up which directly correlates with the floors themselves. The buttons for the floors are also spaced apart from the door buttons which also helps reduce the confusion on the functions of each button. One thing that can possibly be changed on this control interface is the size of the labels for the buttons. The labels are the same size as the buttons themselves so if a user is not paying attention they might try pressing on the label instead of the button. Having these button labels be flush with the panel rather than elevated will help make the actual button itself pop out more
