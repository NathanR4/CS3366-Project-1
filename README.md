This elevator is in the building where I work.

This elevator control interface is clean and it is clear what numbers and icons go to their respective buttons. This control interface also has braille on the buttons so a blind user is still able to operate the interface. The buttons do light up when pressed which is a clear indication of feedback. The layout of the floor buttons are going from the bottom up which directly correlates with the floors themselves. The buttons for the floors are also spaced apart from the door buttons which also helps reduce the confusion on the functions of each button. One thing that can possibly be changed on this control interface is the size of the labels for the buttons. The labels are the same size as the buttons themselves so if a user is not paying attention they might try pressing on the label instead of the button. Having these button labels be flush with the panel rather than elevated will help make the actual button itself pop out more

B:

My most common uses are pressing the button of the floor I want to go to, pressing the ground floor button, and I also usually press the close door button. I do not think I have ever used the open door button or any type of button that is similar to the bell button. Luckily I have never used the help button while on an elevator either. After entering an elevator typically users will look directly at the control panel and then press a button to get to their desired floor, and I have often seen users also pressing the close door button to get the doors to close faster. Once they get to their floor, they then exit the elevator. Also while users may not always go the same floors going up, most if not every time, users will at some point press the ground or first floor button so they can exit the building. The use of the icons is what lets the user know how to operate the interface. The user can identify which button will take them to the floor they need as well as how to operate the doors and call for help if needed. An activated button will glow red to indicate that it is pushed and the elevator will make a stop at the selected floor. I previously mentioned that the section that contains the icons is the same size as the buttons themselves so a user who is not looking carefully might press the wrong section instead of the actual button. To mitigate this mistake I think keeping the numbers and icons flush on the panel instead of elevated will be a more clear indication that it is not a button. Also moving the floor buttons to the center will make better use of the empty space in the middle of the panel.
